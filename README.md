## Final Project : Company Management System
Defined some employees and managers first, gave them names, numbers (sort of like IDs) and decided what languages they speak.
Then wrote some if statements in order to createa program that would ask the user to enter the ID/number of the employee and then print out the languages this employee speaks.
